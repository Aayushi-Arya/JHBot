The Jamia Hamdard Chatbot is a QA system fine-tuned on a custom university-specific SQuAD dataset. It uses Hugging Face’s RobertaForQuestionAnswering model to provide accurate, offline responses via Jupyter. Designed for educational support, it’s adaptable to other domains with minimal modifications.
