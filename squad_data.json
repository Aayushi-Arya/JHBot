These open avenues are wide and enable students to enhance their technical skills. These also help the students to showcase their talent with several non-technical events organized from time to time. Besides exemplary academic record our department also has an MoU with Reaching Sky Foundation (an NGO) which targets the social causes and perform several programs that fall under Unnat Bharat, Govt. of India, scheme.The department has a pool of highly qualified teachers and technical staff members as per UGC/AICTE norms. Several teachers of the department have been awarded/granted National and International patents. The vibrancy of research programs at the department is accentuated by the high-quality publications including books, book chapters, scientific papers and research articles in highly reputed indexed journals with indexing services like SCI, SCIE, SCOPUS and Springer. In addition, Research projects from several govt. agencies like UGC, DST, DBT, DIT, AICTE are to the credit of the faculty members. The department also has an Entrepreneurship cell (E-cell) which motivates the students to think about innovations in day-to-day life. To sensitize students of the department about societal issues related to women, it has an active Women-cell which conducts activities related to women and girl students. An Institution Innovation cell approved by the MHRD's Innovation Cell, Govt. of India has been bestowed upon to the institution. The Department has been recognized by the Department of Science and Technology with a grant approved under the FIST scheme.",
